## Basic Prompting

I've been experimenting with Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) such as ChatGPT and trying to come up with a better way to prompt, which I'll share with you now. ChatGPT is a valuable tool, but despite its vast ability, PLMs like ChatGPT struggle with more complex and multi-step reasoning tasks.

That's why I've structured this article into three levels of difficultyâ€”beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To effectively and efficiently utilize ChatGPT, it's essential to have a clear understanding of how the model works and to develop a strategic approach when prompting it. This is where understanding the different input types come in. But you might be wondering, aren't input and prompts the same thing?

### The Difference Between an Input and a Prompt

Input and prompts are closely related concepts in the context of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT. The input is the data or information provided to the model, while the prompt is the specific question or task that the model is being asked to perform.

Prompts are a form of input, they are a specific form of input in which the input is a question or a task. The prompt is typically a text string that is used to specify the task that the model should perform. It could be a simple text prompt such as "generate a summary of this article" or a more complex query "What are some ways to improve employee retention in a small business?".

In general, the goal of the prompt is to provide the model with the necessary information and context to generate an accurate and relevant output. The input, on the other hand, is the data that the model uses to generate the output.

So while inputs and prompts are closely related, they are not the same thing. Inputs are a broader category of information provided to the model, while prompts are a specific type of input used to specify the task that the model should perform.

Think of it as being the key to unlocking ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's dive in and get to know the five basic input types that will make you a ChatGPT pro in no time:

## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types

These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific. Now let's define these terms as it relates to ChatGPT.


### Combining Input Types (Putting it all together!)

By combining these different input types, the model is provided with a clear goal, an example to base the output on, and specific guidelines to follow in order to generate an accurate and relevant output.

Keep in mind that there are many ways to use input types, many ways to categorize information, and many combinations of words to explore, this is just one example, but by experimenting with different inputs types you will probably stumble onto a useful combination that fits your needs.
