Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\n                        </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\n                    </p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing. When working with prompt input, it's important to be mindful of the level of specificity, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of prompt inputs, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Example Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Example Input</strong> This type of input is used to provide <strong>example or sample data</strong> to the model, which can be used to guide the model's output and make it more consistent with a specific style or format.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Example Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Plot:</b> The year is 2084, AI have manifested into physical reality and are destroying the world.<br>\r\n                                <b>perspective:</b>  We see the story through the eyes of a young girl named Ella. <br>\r\n                                <b>Style:</b> The story is written in the style of Stephen King. <br>\r\n                                <b>Theme:</b> Betrayal <br>\r\n                                <b>Genere:</b> Science Fiction \r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Weapon Title:</b> Steel Sword \r\n                                <br>\r\n                               <b>Weapon description:</b> This steel sword was forged in the Firey Hammer blacksmith shop of Asmonveld.\r\n                                <br>  \r\n                                <b>weapon class:</b> sword\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Material:</b> steel\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>attack:</b> 23\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Durability:</b> 7\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Range:</b> 2\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Example input is a powerful tool for providing context and guidance to the model, allowing it to generate output that is consistent with a specific style or format. This type of input can be used to guide the model's output in a variety of ways, such as providing sample data for language translation tasks, or giving examples of a specific style for creative writing tasks. It is also useful for providing constraints on the output, such as a specific genre or theme, to ensure that the generated content aligns with the desired outcome. With example input, it's important to be mindful of the level of detail provided, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of example input, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary class=\"label-medium\">Constraint Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Constraints Input</strong> is used to provide specific constraints or rules that the model should follow when generating its output.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\n                        </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\n                    </p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing. When working with prompt input, it's important to be mindful of the level of specificity, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of prompt inputs, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Example Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Example Input</strong> This type of input is used to provide <strong>example or sample data</strong> to the model, which can be used to guide the model's output and make it more consistent with a specific style or format.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Example Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Plot:</b> The year is 2084, AI have manifested into physical reality and are destroying the world.<br>\r\n                                <b>perspective:</b>  We see the story through the eyes of a young girl named Ella. <br>\r\n                                <b>Style:</b> The story is written in the style of Stephen King. <br>\r\n                                <b>Theme:</b> Betrayal <br>\r\n                                <b>Genere:</b> Science Fiction \r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Weapon Title:</b> Steel Sword \r\n                                <br>\r\n                               <b>Weapon description:</b> This steel sword was forged in the Firey Hammer blacksmith shop of Asmonveld.\r\n                                <br>  \r\n                                <b>weapon class:</b> sword\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Material:</b> steel\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>attack:</b> 23\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Durability:</b> 7\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Range:</b> 2\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Example input is a powerful tool for providing context and guidance to the model, allowing it to generate output that is consistent with a specific style or format. This type of input can be used to guide the model's output in a variety of ways, such as providing sample data for language translation tasks, or giving examples of a specific style for creative writing tasks. It is also useful for providing constraints on the output, such as a specific genre or theme, to ensure that the generated content aligns with the desired outcome. With example input, it's important to be mindful of the level of detail provided, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of example input, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary class=\"label-medium\">Constraint Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Constraints Input</strong> is used to provide specific constraints or rules that the model should follow when generating its output.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\n                        </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\n                    </p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing. When working with prompt input, it's important to be mindful of the level of specificity, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of prompt inputs, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Example Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Example Input</strong> This type of input is used to provide <strong>example or sample data</strong> to the model, which can be used to guide the model's output and make it more consistent with a specific style or format.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Example Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Plot:</b> The year is 2084, AI have manifested into physical reality and are destroying the world.<br>\r\n                                <b>perspective:</b>  We see the story through the eyes of a young girl named Ella. <br>\r\n                                <b>Style:</b> The story is written in the style of Stephen King. <br>\r\n                                <b>Theme:</b> Betrayal <br>\r\n                                <b>Genere:</b> Science Fiction \r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Weapon Title:</b> Steel Sword \r\n                                <br>\r\n                               <b>Weapon description:</b> This steel sword was forged in the Firey Hammer blacksmith shop of Asmonveld.\r\n                                <br>  \r\n                                <b>weapon class:</b> sword\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Material:</b> steel\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>attack:</b> 23\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Durability:</b> 7\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Range:</b> 2\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Example input is a powerful tool for providing context and guidance to the model, allowing it to generate output that is consistent with a specific style or format. This type of input can be used to guide the model's output in a variety of ways, such as providing sample data for language translation tasks, or giving examples of a specific style for creative writing tasks. It is also useful for providing constraints on the output, such as a specific genre or theme, to ensure that the generated content aligns with the desired outcome. With example input, it's important to be mindful of the level of detail provided, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of example input, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary class=\"label-medium\">Constraint Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Constraints Input</strong> is used to provide specific constraints or rules that the model should follow when generating its output.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\n                        </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\n                    </p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing. When working with prompt input, it's important to be mindful of the level of specificity, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of prompt inputs, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Example Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Example Input</strong> This type of input is used to provide <strong>example or sample data</strong> to the model, which can be used to guide the model's output and make it more consistent with a specific style or format.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Example Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Plot:</b> The year is 2084, AI have manifested into physical reality and are destroying the world.<br>\r\n                                <b>perspective:</b>  We see the story through the eyes of a young girl named Ella. <br>\r\n                                <b>Style:</b> The story is written in the style of Stephen King. <br>\r\n                                <b>Theme:</b> Betrayal <br>\r\n                                <b>Genere:</b> Science Fiction \r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Weapon Title:</b> Steel Sword \r\n                                <br>\r\n                               <b>Weapon description:</b> This steel sword was forged in the Firey Hammer blacksmith shop of Asmonveld.\r\n                                <br>  \r\n                                <b>weapon class:</b> sword\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Material:</b> steel\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>attack:</b> 23\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Durability:</b> 7\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Range:</b> 2\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Example input is a powerful tool for providing context and guidance to the model, allowing it to generate output that is consistent with a specific style or format. This type of input can be used to guide the model's output in a variety of ways, such as providing sample data for language translation tasks, or giving examples of a specific style for creative writing tasks. It is also useful for providing constraints on the output, such as a specific genre or theme, to ensure that the generated content aligns with the desired outcome. With example input, it's important to be mindful of the level of detail provided, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of example input, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary class=\"label-medium\">Constraint Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Constraints Input</strong> is used to provide specific constraints or rules that the model should follow when generating its output.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\n                        </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\n                    </p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing. When working with prompt input, it's important to be mindful of the level of specificity, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of prompt inputs, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Example Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Example Input</strong> This type of input is used to provide <strong>example or sample data</strong> to the model, which can be used to guide the model's output and make it more consistent with a specific style or format.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Example Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Plot:</b> The year is 2084, AI have manifested into physical reality and are destroying the world.<br>\r\n                                <b>perspective:</b>  We see the story through the eyes of a young girl named Ella. <br>\r\n                                <b>Style:</b> The story is written in the style of Stephen King. <br>\r\n                                <b>Theme:</b> Betrayal <br>\r\n                                <b>Genere:</b> Science Fiction \r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Weapon Title:</b> Steel Sword \r\n                                <br>\r\n                               <b>Weapon description:</b> This steel sword was forged in the Firey Hammer blacksmith shop of Asmonveld.\r\n                                <br>  \r\n                                <b>weapon class:</b> sword\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Material:</b> steel\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>attack:</b> 23\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Durability:</b> 7\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Range:</b> 2\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Example input is a powerful tool for providing context and guidance to the model, allowing it to generate output that is consistent with a specific style or format. This type of input can be used to guide the model's output in a variety of ways, such as providing sample data for language translation tasks, or giving examples of a specific style for creative writing tasks. It is also useful for providing constraints on the output, such as a specific genre or theme, to ensure that the generated content aligns with the desired outcome. With example input, it's important to be mindful of the level of detail provided, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of example input, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary class=\"label-medium\">Constraint Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Constraints Input</strong> is used to provide specific constraints or rules that the model should follow when generating its output.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\n                        </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\n                    </p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing. When working with prompt input, it's important to be mindful of the level of specificity, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of prompt inputs, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Example Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Example Input</strong> This type of input is used to provide <strong>example or sample data</strong> to the model, which can be used to guide the model's output and make it more consistent with a specific style or format.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Example Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Plot:</b> The year is 2084, AI have manifested into physical reality and are destroying the world.<br>\r\n                                <b>perspective:</b>  We see the story through the eyes of a young girl named Ella. <br>\r\n                                <b>Style:</b> The story is written in the style of Stephen King. <br>\r\n                                <b>Theme:</b> Betrayal <br>\r\n                                <b>Genere:</b> Science Fiction \r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Weapon Title:</b> Steel Sword \r\n                                <br>\r\n                               <b>Weapon description:</b> This steel sword was forged in the Firey Hammer blacksmith shop of Asmonveld.\r\n                                <br>  \r\n                                <b>weapon class:</b> sword\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Material:</b> steel\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>attack:</b> 23\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Durability:</b> 7\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Range:</b> 2\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Example input is a powerful tool for providing context and guidance to the model, allowing it to generate output that is consistent with a specific style or format. This type of input can be used to guide the model's output in a variety of ways, such as providing sample data for language translation tasks, or giving examples of a specific style for creative writing tasks. It is also useful for providing constraints on the output, such as a specific genre or theme, to ensure that the generated content aligns with the desired outcome. With example input, it's important to be mindful of the level of detail provided, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of example input, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary class=\"label-medium\">Constraint Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Constraints Input</strong> is used to provide specific constraints or rules that the model should follow when generating its output.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model. It can be used to address specific issues or areas of improvement that have been identified. Additionally, collecting and analyzing feedback over time can also help identify patterns and trends that can be used to further improve the model's performance.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Adversarial Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Adversarial Input</strong> is used to test the model's robustness by providing it with inputs that are designed to be difficult or misleading.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Adversarial Input is a powerful tool for evaluating the robustness of a model, as it allows you to test the model's ability to handle inputs that are designed to be difficult or misleading. This type of input can help identify weaknesses in the model and inform future improvements. Examples of adversarial inputs include providing a model with a text prompt that uses a lot of technical jargon, or providing a model with a list of quotes that are out of context. It is important to note that when using adversarial inputs, it is important to clearly define the parameters of the test and interpret the results with caution, as the model's performance on adversarial inputs may not necessarily reflect its performance on real-world inputs.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Initial Input (Easy Template)</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">          \r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                       <strong>Initial Input</strong> is the first input provided to the model, and it serves as a starting point for the model's output.

By providing the model with a clear and well-defined starting point, we can ensure that the output is relevant and on-topic. This is particularly important when working on broad topic generation or ideation tasks, as it helps to guide the model's output and keep it focused on the desired topic. Additionally, providing a specific and clear initial input can also help to improve the performance of the model, as it allows the model to better understand the task at hand and generate more accurate and useful output.\r\n                     </p>\r\n                     <p class=\"margin-top-8 p-content-s\">\r\n                         \r\n                     </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Combining Input Types: The Grand Finale\r\n\r\nBy blending these diverse input types, we equip the model with a clear objective, a referential example for output generation, and precise guidelines for producing accurate and relevant results.\r\n\r\nRemember, there are limitless ways to utilize input types, categorize information, and explore various word combinations.

However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n        <details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. [Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈](https://chat.openai.com/)\r\n\r\n## The Art of Basic Prompting\r\n\r\nAs a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I've embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I'm thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing. When working with prompt input, it's important to be mindful of the level of specificity, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of prompt inputs, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Example Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Example Input</strong> This type of input is used to provide <strong>example or sample data</strong> to the model, which can be used to guide the model's output and make it more consistent with a specific style or format.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Example Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Plot:</b> The year is 2084, AI have manifested into physical reality and are destroying the world.<br>\r\n                                <b>perspective:</b>  We see the story through the eyes of a young girl named Ella. <br>\r\n                                <b>Style:</b> The story is written in the style of Stephen King. <br>\r\n                                <b>Theme:</b> Betrayal <br>\r\n                                <b>Genere:</b> Science Fiction \r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Weapon Title:</b> Steel Sword \r\n                                <br>\r\n                               <b>Weapon description:</b> This steel sword was forged in the Firey Hammer blacksmith shop of Asmonveld.\r\n                                <br>  \r\n                                <b>weapon class:</b> sword\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Material:</b> steel\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>attack:</b> 23\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Durability:</b> 7\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Range:</b> 2\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Example input is a powerful tool for providing context and guidance to the model, allowing it to generate output that is consistent with a specific style or format. This type of input can be used to guide the model's output in a variety of ways, such as providing sample data for language translation tasks, or giving examples of a specific style for creative writing tasks. It is also useful for providing constraints on the output, such as a specific genre or theme, to ensure that the generated content aligns with the desired outcome. With example input, it's important to be mindful of the level of detail provided, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of example input, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary class=\"label-medium\">Constraint Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Constraints Input</strong> is used to provide specific constraints or rules that the model should follow when generating its output.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\n                        </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\n                    </p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing. When working with prompt input, it's important to be mindful of the level of specificity, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of prompt inputs, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Example Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Example Input</strong> This type of input is used to provide <strong>example or sample data</strong> to the model, which can be used to guide the model's output and make it more consistent with a specific style or format.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Example Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Plot:</b> The year is 2084, AI have manifested into physical reality and are destroying the world.<br>\r\n                                <b>perspective:</b>  We see the story through the eyes of a young girl named Ella. <br>\r\n                                <b>Style:</b> The story is written in the style of Stephen King. <br>\r\n                                <b>Theme:</b> Betrayal <br>\r\n                                <b>Genere:</b> Science Fiction \r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Weapon Title:</b> Steel Sword \r\n                                <br>\r\n                               <b>Weapon description:</b> This steel sword was forged in the Firey Hammer blacksmith shop of Asmonveld.\r\n                                <br>  \r\n                                <b>weapon class:</b> sword\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Material:</b> steel\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>attack:</b> 23\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Durability:</b> 7\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Range:</b> 2\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Example input is a powerful tool for providing context and guidance to the model, allowing it to generate output that is consistent with a specific style or format. This type of input can be used to guide the model's output in a variety of ways, such as providing sample data for language translation tasks, or giving examples of a specific style for creative writing tasks. It is also useful for providing constraints on the output, such as a specific genre or theme, to ensure that the generated content aligns with the desired outcome. With example input, it's important to be mindful of the level of detail provided, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of example input, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary class=\"label-medium\">Constraint Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Constraints Input</strong> is used to provide specific constraints or rules that the model should follow when generating its output.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\n                        </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\n                    </p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing. When working with prompt input, it's important to be mindful of the level of specificity, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of prompt inputs, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Example Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Example Input</strong> This type of input is used to provide <strong>example or sample data</strong> to the model, which can be used to guide the model's output and make it more consistent with a specific style or format.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Example Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Plot:</b> The year is 2084, AI have manifested into physical reality and are destroying the world.<br>\r\n                                <b>perspective:</b>  We see the story through the eyes of a young girl named Ella. <br>\r\n                                <b>Style:</b> The story is written in the style of Stephen King. <br>\r\n                                <b>Theme:</b> Betrayal <br>\r\n                                <b>Genere:</b> Science Fiction \r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Weapon Title:</b> Steel Sword \r\n                                <br>\r\n                               <b>Weapon description:</b> This steel sword was forged in the Firey Hammer blacksmith shop of Asmonveld.\r\n                                <br>  \r\n                                <b>weapon class:</b> sword\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Material:</b> steel\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>attack:</b> 23\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Durability:</b> 7\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Range:</b> 2\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Example input is a powerful tool for providing context and guidance to the model, allowing it to generate output that is consistent with a specific style or format. This type of input can be used to guide the model's output in a variety of ways, such as providing sample data for language translation tasks, or giving examples of a specific style for creative writing tasks. It is also useful for providing constraints on the output, such as a specific genre or theme, to ensure that the generated content aligns with the desired outcome. With example input, it's important to be mindful of the level of detail provided, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of example input, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary class=\"label-medium\">Constraint Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Constraints Input</strong> is used to provide specific constraints or rules that the model should follow when generating its output.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\n                        </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\n                    </p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing. When working with prompt input, it's important to be mindful of the level of specificity, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of prompt inputs, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Example Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Example Input</strong> This type of input is used to provide <strong>example or sample data</strong> to the model, which can be used to guide the model's output and make it more consistent with a specific style or format.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Example Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Plot:</b> The year is 2084, AI have manifested into physical reality and are destroying the world.<br>\r\n                                <b>perspective:</b>  We see the story through the eyes of a young girl named Ella. <br>\r\n                                <b>Style:</b> The story is written in the style of Stephen King. <br>\r\n                                <b>Theme:</b> Betrayal <br>\r\n                                <b>Genere:</b> Science Fiction \r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Weapon Title:</b> Steel Sword \r\n                                <br>\r\n                               <b>Weapon description:</b> This steel sword was forged in the Firey Hammer blacksmith shop of Asmonveld.\r\n                                <br>  \r\n                                <b>weapon class:</b> sword\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Material:</b> steel\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>attack:</b> 23\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Durability:</b> 7\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Range:</b> 2\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Example input is a powerful tool for providing context and guidance to the model, allowing it to generate output that is consistent with a specific style or format. This type of input can be used to guide the model's output in a variety of ways, such as providing sample data for language translation tasks, or giving examples of a specific style for creative writing tasks. It is also useful for providing constraints on the output, such as a specific genre or theme, to ensure that the generated content aligns with the desired outcome. With example input, it's important to be mindful of the level of detail provided, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of example input, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary class=\"label-medium\">Constraint Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Constraints Input</strong> is used to provide specific constraints or rules that the model should follow when generating its output.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\n                        </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\n                    </p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing. When working with prompt input, it's important to be mindful of the level of specificity, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of prompt inputs, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Example Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Example Input</strong> This type of input is used to provide <strong>example or sample data</strong> to the model, which can be used to guide the model's output and make it more consistent with a specific style or format.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Example Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Plot:</b> The year is 2084, AI have manifested into physical reality and are destroying the world.<br>\r\n                                <b>perspective:</b>  We see the story through the eyes of a young girl named Ella. <br>\r\n                                <b>Style:</b> The story is written in the style of Stephen King. <br>\r\n                                <b>Theme:</b> Betrayal <br>\r\n                                <b>Genere:</b> Science Fiction \r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Weapon Title:</b> Steel Sword \r\n                                <br>\r\n                               <b>Weapon description:</b> This steel sword was forged in the Firey Hammer blacksmith shop of Asmonveld.\r\n                                <br>  \r\n                                <b>weapon class:</b> sword\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Material:</b> steel\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>attack:</b> 23\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Durability:</b> 7\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Range:</b> 2\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Example input is a powerful tool for providing context and guidance to the model, allowing it to generate output that is consistent with a specific style or format. This type of input can be used to guide the model's output in a variety of ways, such as providing sample data for language translation tasks, or giving examples of a specific style for creative writing tasks. It is also useful for providing constraints on the output, such as a specific genre or theme, to ensure that the generated content aligns with the desired outcome. With example input, it's important to be mindful of the level of detail provided, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of example input, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary class=\"label-medium\">Constraint Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Constraints Input</strong> is used to provide specific constraints or rules that the model should follow when generating its output.

Time to fire up that browser and head on over to openai.com. <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Open chatGPT from openai.com, then come right back 👈</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-basic-prompting\">The Art of Basic Prompting</h2>\n<p>As a seasoned explorer of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) like ChatGPT, I’ve embarked on a relentless quest to devise an optimal strategy for prompting - a treasure trove of insights that I’m thrilled to share with you today. ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p>Hence, I’ve organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it’s paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren’t inputs and prompts identical?</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciphering-the-nuances-input-vs-prompt\">Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt</h3>\n<p>In the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.</p>\n<p>Prompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as “generate a summary of this article” to a complex query like “What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?“.</p>\n<p>In essence, the prompt’s mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.</p>\n<p>Thus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.</p>\n<p>Consider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT’s true potential. So, let’s plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:</p>\n<h2 id=\"harnessing-system-messages\">Harnessing System Messages</h2>\n<p>Hello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I’m here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT’s advanced features - system messages.</p>\n<p>System messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model’s responses. But before we delve into that, let’s do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-system-messages\">What are System Messages?</h3>\n<p>Now, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4’s output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.</p>\n<p>In essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn’t interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.</p>\n<p>For instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: “You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.”</p>\n<p>With this system message, we’ve set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-use-system-messages\">Why Use System Messages?</h3>\n<p>So, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?</p>\n<p>Well, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it’s not omniscient. The model doesn’t have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.</p>\n<p>By using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4’s outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practical-applications-of-system-messages\">Practical Applications of System Messages</h3>\n<p>The applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you’re generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.</p>\n<p>In content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.</p>\n<p>In interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you’re designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like “You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner” can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"in-conclusion\">In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Mastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content’s style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI’s responses align beautifully with your expectations.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don’t forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-beginner-chatgpt-input-types\">7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types</h2>\n<p>These inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\n                        </p>\n                </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\n                    </p>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\n                    </p>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                    </section>\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing.

ChatGPT is indeed a potent tool, yet like any sophisticated AI model, PLMs such as ChatGPT encounter hurdles when faced with intricate, multi-faceted reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nHence, I've organized this article into three layers of complexity—beginner, intermediate, and advanced. To wield the power of ChatGPT effectively and judiciously, it's paramount to decode the inner workings of the model and cultivate a tactical approach to prompting it. This paves the way for comprehending the diverse spectrum of input types. But a question might be simmering in your mind – aren't inputs and prompts identical?\r\n\r\n### Deciphering the Nuances: Input vs. Prompt\r\n\r\nIn the realm of pre-trained language models like ChatGPT, input and prompts are often confused as synonyms. However, the two harbor subtle differences. The input is the raw data or information that you feed into the model, while the prompt constitutes the explicit question or task that you assign to the model.\r\n\r\nPrompts are a subtype of inputs, embodying a unique form where the input translates into a question or a task. The prompt, typically a textual instruction, outlines the task that the model is expected to execute. It can range from a straightforward request such as \"generate a summary of this article\" to a complex query like \"What are some strategies to bolster employee retention in a small business?\".\r\n\r\nIn essence, the prompt's mission is to equip the model with the necessary information and context to fabricate an accurate and pertinent output. Conversely, the input serves as the data used by the model to manifest this output.\r\n\r\nThus, although inputs and prompts bear a close relationship, they are not identical. Inputs represent a wider category of information offered to the model, while prompts constitute a specialized variant of input used to delineate the task the model is expected to perform.\r\n\r\nConsider this analogy: prompts are the keys that ignite the roaring engine of ChatGPT's true potential. So, let's plunge into the depths and acquaint ourselves with the five fundamental input types that will catapult you into the elite league of ChatGPT pros in no time:\r\n\r\n## Harnessing System Messages\r\nHello again, and welcome back to our exciting journey into the world of ChatGPT. As a UX designer at UXWRLD, my passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies and ensuring that their potential is harnessed in the most user-friendly ways possible. Today, I'm here to guide you through another vital aspect of ChatGPT's advanced features - system messages.\r\n\r\nSystem messages are a form of input that can drastically affect the direction, tone, and context of the text generated by GPT-4. Their power lies in their ability to provide a backstory or context to the AI model, significantly influencing the model's responses. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick recap of what GPT-4 is and how it works.\r\n\r\n### What are System Messages?\r\nNow, you may wonder what exactly are system messages and how they can help in enhancing the quality of GPT-4's output. System messages are instructions or directives that we can give to GPT-4 before the actual conversation or task prompt.\r\n\r\nIn essence, a system message is like setting the stage for a play. It doesn't interact directly with the plot (or in this case, the task at hand), but it provides a backdrop that informs the actions and dialogues of the characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider a scenario where you want GPT-4 to generate a step-by-step recipe in the style of a lively and enthusiastic cooking instructor. A system message for this could be: \"You are an enthusiastic cooking instructor explaining the process of making a cheese soufflé.\"\r\n\r\nWith this system message, we've set the persona GPT-4 should adopt, along with the tone and style of the output. The result is a conversation that not only provides information but does so in a fun, engaging, and energetic way.\r\n\r\n### Why Use System Messages?\r\nSo, why bother with system messages? Why not just throw our prompts at GPT-4 and let it do its thing?\r\n\r\nWell, while GPT-4 is a powerful model capable of generating impressively human-like text, it's not omniscient. The model doesn't have a pre-existing understanding of the context, tone, or style we might want in our output.\r\n\r\nBy using system messages, we essentially provide a guidepost for GPT-4. We can direct the AI to adopt a specific persona, maintain a particular tone, or even write in a certain style. In doing so, we can ensure that GPT-4's outputs align more closely with our expectations and needs.\r\n\r\n### Practical Applications of System Messages\r\nThe applications of system messages with GPT-4 are nearly limitless. Whether you're generating creative content, drafting business communication, or designing an AI-powered interactive application, system messages can significantly enhance the relevance and appeal of the generated text.\r\n\r\nIn content generation, for example, system messages can set the tone and style of the output, be it a hilarious joke, a thrilling short story, or a calming bedtime tale. For business communication, a system message can ensure a professional tone is maintained throughout the text.\r\n\r\nIn interactive applications, system messages can help GPT-4 maintain consistent personas. For instance, if you're designing an AI chatbot for a vintage music store, a system message like \"You are an expert on vintage music and instruments, and you communicate in a friendly and helpful manner\" can guide GPT-4 in its interactions with users.\r\n\r\n### In Conclusion\r\nMastering the use of system messages with GPT-4 can open up new dimensions of interaction with the model. It enables a level of control over the generated content's style, tone, and persona that would be hard to achieve otherwise. So next time you prompt GPT-4, remember to set the stage first with a well-crafted system message. Harness the power of context and watch the AI's responses align beautifully with your expectations.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more insights into GPT-4 and other exciting advancements in UX design, and don't forget to experiment with your own system messages. After all, exploration and creativity are at the heart of UX design. Happy prompting!\r\n\r\n## 7 Beginner ChatGPT Input Types\r\n\r\nThese inputs are like the secret sauce that will make your ChatGPT outputs 10 times more productive, useful and specific.

The goal input is essentially the overarching purpose or objective of the task. An effective way to use the goal input is to start with a broad goal and then break it down into smaller, more specific goals as you progrees through the thread. This allows you to focus on the most important aspects of the task while still maintaining a clear overall objective.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Prompt Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Prompt Input</strong> is the primary input provided to the model, and serves as the most specific task that the model is supposed to perform.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-margin-bottom-4\"><b>Prompt Input Examples:</b>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a 750 word science fiction story titled: 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI'\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Prompt: Create a top 10 list on ways to earn extra income, ranked in order of effectiveness.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                                        <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                               Prompt: Write a list of 10 quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            The prompt input serves as a guide for the model, providing it with clear instructions on what it should be doing. When working with prompt input, it's important to be mindful of the level of specificity, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of prompt inputs, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Example Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Example Input</strong> This type of input is used to provide <strong>example or sample data</strong> to the model, which can be used to guide the model's output and make it more consistent with a specific style or format.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Example Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Plot:</b> The year is 2084, AI have manifested into physical reality and are destroying the world.<br>\r\n                                <b>perspective:</b>  We see the story through the eyes of a young girl named Ella. <br>\r\n                                <b>Style:</b> The story is written in the style of Stephen King. <br>\r\n                                <b>Theme:</b> Betrayal <br>\r\n                                <b>Genere:</b> Science Fiction \r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Example: <br>\r\n                                <b>Weapon Title:</b> Steel Sword \r\n                                <br>\r\n                               <b>Weapon description:</b> This steel sword was forged in the Firey Hammer blacksmith shop of Asmonveld.\r\n                                <br>  \r\n                                <b>weapon class:</b> sword\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Material:</b> steel\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>attack:</b> 23\r\n                                <br> \r\n                                <b>Durability:</b> 7\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Range:</b> 2\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            Example input is a powerful tool for providing context and guidance to the model, allowing it to generate output that is consistent with a specific style or format. This type of input can be used to guide the model's output in a variety of ways, such as providing sample data for language translation tasks, or giving examples of a specific style for creative writing tasks. It is also useful for providing constraints on the output, such as a specific genre or theme, to ensure that the generated content aligns with the desired outcome. With example input, it's important to be mindful of the level of detail provided, as too much or too little can impact the model's performance. A good practice is to test different variations of example input, and evaluate the results to find the most effective one for a given task.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary class=\"label-medium\">Constraint Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Constraints Input</strong> is used to provide specific constraints or rules that the model should follow when generating its output.

It's also important to test different variations of constraints input and evaluate the results to find the most effective set of rules for a given task. Additionally, it's important to consider the balance between constraining the model too much and not providing enough guidance, as this can also impact the model's performance. Combining constraints input with other input types, such as goal input or example input, can help provide a more well-rounded and effective prompt for the model to work with.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Feedback Input:</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                        <strong>Feedback Input</strong> is used to provide feedback or evaluation data to the model, which can be used to improve its performance over time.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16 margin-bottom-4\"><b>Feedback Input Examples:</b></p>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Feedback: The story 'Digimon IRL: Attack of the AI' is too similar to existing franchise, please make it more unique.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Feedback: The list on ways to earn extra income could use more specific examples for each method.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                    <section class=\"details-container-c\">\r\n                        <div class=\"copy-content\">\r\n                            <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                                Feedback: The quotes about both physical fitness and mental attitude are well written but could use more diversity in the authors.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </section>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text margin-top-16\"><b>More info:</b></p>\r\n                        <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                            More info: Feedback input is an important tool for fine-tuning the model's performance and can be used to provide guidance and improve the overall quality of the output generated by the model.

This type of input can help identify weaknesses in the model and inform future improvements. Examples of adversarial inputs include providing a model with a text prompt that uses a lot of technical jargon, or providing a model with a list of quotes that are out of context. It is important to note that when using adversarial inputs, it is important to clearly define the parameters of the test and interpret the results with caution, as the model's performance on adversarial inputs may not necessarily reflect its performance on real-world inputs.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n        <details>\r\n            <summary class=\"label-medium\">Initial Input (Easy Template)</summary>\r\n                <div class=\"details-container\">          \r\n                    <p class=\"copy-text\">\r\n                       <strong>Initial Input</strong> is the first input provided to the model, and it serves as a starting point for the model's output.

By providing the model with a clear and well-defined starting point, we can ensure that the output is relevant and on-topic. This is particularly important when working on broad topic generation or ideation tasks, as it helps to guide the model's output and keep it focused on the desired topic. Additionally, providing a specific and clear initial input can also help to improve the performance of the model, as it allows the model to better understand the task at hand and generate more accurate and useful output.\r\n                     </p>\r\n                     <p class=\"margin-top-8 p-content-s\">\r\n                         \r\n                     </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n</details>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n### Combining Input Types: The Grand Finale\r\n\r\nBy blending these diverse input types, we equip the model with a clear objective, a referential example for output generation, and precise guidelines for producing accurate and relevant results.\r\n\r\nRemember, there are limitless ways to utilize input types, categorize information, and explore various word combinations.
